Stand Up Day 2


Riya:
I had a decent  experience yesterday. It was not so good as I was very nervous and forgot the right terminology while answering questions in QC.
Loom was also okay as I was unable to explain 3 coding questions and other two prompts were also not as good as expected because I was not able to deliver what I wanted to say.
I need to work on coding and what does that mean, i understand code when explained but I could not format it myself.
I would work in a banking app.
Levi:
His Qc went well . He was a little slow while describing the code because he was trying to understand it. He said he should learn how to summarize better. 
His QC went well and wanted to work on a banking application and already started to work on outline.


Veronica:
Her loom went pretty well, not perfect but it was satisfactory.
Qc was not terrible as she described. It went pretty well for her.
She would also work in a banking app.


Catherine:
She said she used a lot of filler words during the process so she would like to work on her vocabulary a little bit more.
During QC she realizes she is not as knowledgeable. 
She is also working on a banking application.


Tenece
Her looms were awkward because she was nervous. She wants to work on not being paused while talking. 
She said she handled QC like a conversation, that helps her to not panic during answering the questions.
She is also working on a banking application.


Ross
He said he had a good experience with loom. He was a little distracted because it was first experience and needed more practice on answering the questions.
He had not so good experience in QC. He was excited for QC but later he was nervous and forgot some of the answers.
He is also working on a banking app.
