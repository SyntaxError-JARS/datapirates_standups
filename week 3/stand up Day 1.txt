Day 1
 Riya 
I was happy that I got to learn about the new programming language Bash and also about Git and Github.
I should work on vocabulary and how to format code.


Levi:
He’s glad he learned about Git Bash and Github, version control systems in general.
He would like to improve his vocabulary as he knows what does that mean but it's hard to explain.


Veronica
She’s glad that she learned about scripting and how to reuse code.
She would like to study more terminology. 


Catherine
She’s glad she got the hang of VS code.
She would like to work on how to format code in general as she knows what that code does but is unable to format. 


Tenece
She’s glad she  knows how to navigate resources through slack and git.
She would like to work on describing process and technical terms.


Ross 
He’s glad that he got to meet new people and work in a team. He is happy about the group learning process.
He would like to learn strategy so that he could focus and  work properly in a particular platform as he got knowledge of various platforms.
