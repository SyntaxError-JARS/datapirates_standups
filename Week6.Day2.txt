How project going so far? What challenges have you run into?


Levi- Yesterday, Veronica and I added all classes, database setup, and got the skeleton done. Need to do testing, ect.


Geoffery- Skeleton done Friday. Catherine worked on models yesterday. Today's goal= get dao done. Roadblock = Catherine had internet problems.


Veronica- Off to a pretty good start. Working on building the rest of the classes today- need to do daos today. 


Catherine- Same as Geoffery said– got a good amount done so far. My internet went out last night in the middle of working on the project.


Tenyce- Ryan and I came up with an outline Friday. We have our tables done, and have started creating classes in IntelliJ. I'm not sure if Ryan's going to continue w/ Revature–
Awaiting a response to see if I'll have a p1 partner. Either way, I'm going to press on.
