Re P1: Where are you in the process? What are you working on? Any problems?


 Veronica: It's going well- Built some of Daos yesterday. Ran into a problem connecting react to IntelliJ. Hoping to resolve it today.


Catherine: We're making good progress– Started on services yesterday. Problem working on separate branches, and then figuring out the best way to merge. We get errors/problems, but It's usually something small–we're working through it.


Geoffrey: Did some Debugging with Catherine yesterday. Going to work on the dao today and do some testing. 


Levi: Added an interface and daos skeleton for the project. 


Tenyce: As of yesterday, I have 2 new team mates. We met yesterday to compare notes, plan an approach, and set individual goals. I'm working on the service layer, and learning React.
Not sure what problems we'll run into as a group (each using different OS'). We each created our own branches yesterday- we'll see what happens when our code is combined–check in later today.
